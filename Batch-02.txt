Information Gathering: 

1. Subdomain Enumeration: Get all the subdomains for the domain 

subfinder
1. apt install subfinder [To install subfinder]
2. subfinder
3. subfinder -up  [to update the version]
4. subfinder -d bcc.gov.bd
5. subfinder -d bcc.gov.bd -o bcc.gov.bd.txt

cat bcc.gov.bd.txt | grep mail


2. Manual Inspection: 
- Visit the website as a normal user. 
- go to view page source [CTRL+U], and search [CTRL+F] for sensitive keywords like: 
api, password, admin, secret, key, token, http, https etc. 

3. Google Dork: 
Google Advaned Searcing technique

site: searching within a specific website/domain
inurl: Find keywords within URL. 
Example: php?id site:vulnvub.in   ->
intitle: 
intext: intext:password site:vulnweb.com
ext: 

4. Technology Lookup (Wappalyzer - Technology profiler): Identify the underlying technologies of the website.

 Kali Linux File System Structure: 
 / (Root Directory): The base of the entire file system hierarchy. All other directories and files branch off from here.
/bin (User Binaries): Contains essential command-line utilities and executable programs accessible to all users (e.g., ls, cp, bash).
/sbin (System Binaries): Holds system administration commands and binaries primarily used by the root user for system maintenance (e.g., fdisk, reboot, ifconfig).
/etc (Configuration Files): Stores system-wide configuration files for various programs and services (e.g., /etc/passwd, /etc/fstab, /etc/resolv.conf).
/dev (Device Files): Contains special files representing hardware devices (e.g., /dev/sda for a hard drive, /dev/tty1 for a terminal).
/proc (Process Information): A virtual filesystem providing information about running processes and kernel parameters (e.g., /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo).
/sys (System Information): Another virtual filesystem for interacting with the kernel and device drivers.
/var (Variable Data): Stores variable data files, such as log files, mail queues, and temporary files that can change frequently (e.g., /var/log, /var/mail).
/tmp (Temporary Files): A directory for temporary files created by users and applications, often cleared on reboot.
/usr (Unix System Resources): Contains a large portion of the system's programs, libraries, documentation, and other resources that are not essential for the system to boot (e.g., /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/share).
/home (User Home Directories): Contains the home directories for regular users, where they store their personal files and configurations (e.g., /home/username).
/root (Root User's Home Directory): The home directory specifically for the root user.
/boot (Boot Files): Contains files necessary for the system to boot, including the Linux kernel and bootloader configuration (e.g., vmlinuz, grub).
/lib (Libraries): Holds essential shared libraries required by programs in /bin and /sbin.
/media (Removable Media): Used as a mount point for removable media devices like USB drives and DVDs.
/mnt (Mount Point): A general-purpose mount point for temporarily mounting file systems.
/opt (Optional Software): Intended for the installation of optional software packages not part of the standard system.
